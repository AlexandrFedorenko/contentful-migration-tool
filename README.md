| The content type could not be found | Content Type is missing in the target environment | Manually transfer Content Types first |
| Cannot delete locale | Locales cannot be removed via API | Manually disable or leave them |
| Asset already exists | Duplicate asset during import | Delete the existing asset and retry |
| Some entries failed to import | Content Type structure changed | Ensure the Content Type exists and is unchanged |
